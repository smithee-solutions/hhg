hhg rasbian

stuff specifically for rasbian on the raspberry pi

to change keyboard layout to US English (sorrry, raspi elves, I can't use bash with her majesty's keyboard layout...)

sudo raspi-config

Note:  as they point out on the site, use the raspi resources if possible.  they're likely to be more 
accurate than whatever a google search gave you.
